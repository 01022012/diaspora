        %p
          Diaspora allows you to sort your connections into groups called Aspects.
          Unique to Diaspora, Aspects ensure your photos, stories and jokes are shared
          with only the people you want them to be.

          Ownership
        %p
          You own your pictures, and you shouldn’t have to give that up just in order
          to share them. You maintain ownership of everything you share on Diaspora,
          giving you full control over how it is distributed.

          Simplicity
        %p
          Diaspora makes sharing clean and easy – this goes doubly so for privacy.
          Innherently private, Diaspora doesn’t have pages of settings and options to
          wade through to keep your profile secure and to your liking.
