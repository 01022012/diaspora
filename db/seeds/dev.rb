# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ :name => 'Chicago' }, { :name => 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(:name => 'Daley', :city => citie

require 'config/environment'

# Create seed user
user = User.create( :email => "robert@joindiaspora.com", :password => "evankorth", :profile => Profile.new( :first_name => "bobert", :last_name => "brin" ))
